			"Check out these ten beautiful castles in Japan that you probably haven\u2019t heard about.",
		articleBody:
			" You might often imagine Europe as the land of castles, moats, and medieval battles. Yet, the castles of samurais and regional lords in Japan harbor dramatic histories of their own. Check out this list of the 10 most beautiful castles in Japan. This hilltop castle is located in Hy\u014dgo Prefecture. The castle complex comprises 83 buildings and Himeji Castle is said to be the most pristine example of traditional Japanese castle architecture. Its exterior is a dazzling white, and many say that the structure resembles an egret taking flight. The samurai warrior Akamatsu Norimura built the castle in 1333 as a fortress, and the initial structure has been subject to significant remodeling schemes over the course of the past several centuries. Namely, several buildings were added as the castle changed hands. The castle miraculously survived WWII unscathed even though surrounding areas were bombed mercilessly. Like many castles on this list, Himeji Castle is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Matsumoto is one of Japan\u2019s principal historic castles; indeed, it is considered a National Treasure of Japan. Because of its black exterior, the castle is commonly known as the \u2018Crow Castle.\u2019 Matsumoto Castle resides in Nagano Prefecture, an easy train ride from Tokyo proper, and is a hirajiro, or flatland castle, which distinguishes it from many others that were strategically constructed on hills or surrounded by rivers. Built in the late 16th century, the fortress consisted of a series of moats, a complex system of walls, and gatehouses. The castle was created during the Sengoku period, a time of considerable social upheaval in Japan. In the late 1800s, it was sold at auction for the purpose of redevelopment. A local high school principal spearheaded the renovation efforts and raised funds to carry them out. Nagoya Castle is located in central Japan. During the Edo period, Nagoya stood within the most significant castle town in the area, Nagoyaa-juku. The castle of today was constructed in the early 17th century; however, its origins date back even further than this. The original castle was called Yanagi-no-maru,and the military governor Imagawa Ujichika built it as a gift for his son during the 1520s. Shortly after its completion, a warlord seized the castle and changed its name to Nagoya Castle. During WWII, the castle was used as a military headquarters and became the site of a POW camp. It was heavily damaged during US army air raids. Osaka Castle is one of Japan\u2019s most famous landmarks. As with many traditional Japanese castles, the Osaka Castle is built on a man-made stonewall; it is eight stories high and surrounded by a moat. The castle was erected on the site of a temple and former imperial palace. In the late 1600s, there was a massive fire in the castle as lightning struck the gunpowder keep, setting everything ablaze in a massive explosion. During its short span of use, the castle played an important role in Japanese unification. In the late 19th century, the castle underwent much needed repairs after years of neglect. The castle was featured in the 1955 film Godzilla Raids Again by Tomoyuki Tanaka. Completed in 1611, Matsue Castle is one of the few remaining medieval castles to still contain its original wooden structure. Though the fact that the castle is predominantly wooden, a major fire hazard, the castle was built after the great war of feudal Japan, so it never saw battle. It is nicknamed the \u2018plover castle\u2019 due to its structure and coloring, which is reminiscent of the type of bird. It is one of the oldest castles in Japan and the only one remaining in the Sanin region. For a 234-year reign spanning over ten generations, Naomasa Matsudaira and his descendants ruled the castle. Today, only the castle tower remains. The Tsugaru clan built the castle in the early 1600s after raising enough money and resources through a number of strategic alliances. It too was destroyed when a lightning bolt struck the gunpowder magazine only about 15 years after its construction \u2013 it was rebuilt two centuries later. Today, the surrounding park is one of the most notorious cherry blossom spots in the country. The park contains 2,600 cherry blossom trees, which were planted on the grounds in 1903. Hirosaki Castle is also the site of the annual Hirosaki Castle Snow Lantern Festival, attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors. The Hikone Castle is located in the Shiga Prefecture. It is considered to be the most important historical building in the entire region and was constructed at the orders of the son of the reigning regional lord, or daimyo. During the Meiji Period of the late 1800s, many castles were commissioned to be dismantled. Hikone Castle was spared by request of the Emperor himself. Many features of the castle are, indeed, considered Japanese cultural assets. These include the stable and three different turrets incorporated in the castle\u2019s architecture. In addition to the Matsue Castle, the Hikone Castle is another on this list that still has its original structure. You will find Shimabara Castle in the Nagasaki Prefecture. It is a hirajiro castle that is located near Mount Unzen and Ariake Bay. Shimabara Castle is known for its moats, which are up to 15 meters deep and 50 meters wide in some areas. The daimyos of Shimabara Castle fostered an oppressive regime, executing many Christians living in their territory and significantly raising taxes to pay for the castle. In the late 1800s, part of the castle was turned into school grounds and much of it became farmland. The castle is now a museum that contains exhibits on local culture and the Shimabara Rebellion during feudal times. The bright crimson Shuri Castle is located in Okinawa and served as the palace for the Ry\u016bky\u016b Kingdom. The castle was an important stop in Japan\u2019s East Asian maritime networks. It dates all the way back to 1429. It was the largest castle on the island, though not necessarily the strongest militarily or economically. The castle has a long history of economic activity, and it has changed hands many times. In the beginning, the Ming Dynasty sent many Chinese families to live here for business purposes. In 1853, the infamous Commodore Matthew Perry paid a visit here as well. The United States occupied the grounds for nearly 30 years following WWII. One of many castles located in Okayama Prefecture, this castle was built in 1597 after almost 20 years of construction. Its owner was captured just three years later and died shortly thereafter without leaving an heir. It is also nicknamed the \u2018crow castle\u2019 because of its black exterior, which is often contrasted with the neighboring, white Himeji Castle. In its heyday, the roof of the main keep consisted of gilded tiles and golden fish gargoyles. Okayama Castle\u2019s main tower was destroyed during WWII. During the 1960s, the castle was restored, and its interior now features air conditioning and elevators. The golden fish gargoyles have been returned to their perches, and entry to the inner sanctuary is free. Here you can find multiple displays explaining the castle\u2019s history.

		articleBody:
			" Beyond the pristine beaches and the Caribbean Sea, there\u2019s a lot more to the Bahamas than first meets the eye. Among the 700 islands lie fascinating tales of pirates and rum-runners. We\u2019ve collected a few of the best places to visit that are individual to the Lucayan Archipelago. No one really knows how the swimming pigs got to Big Major Cay, but the 25 pigs and piglets that live here are certainly the star attraction of the Exuma Cays in the Bahamas. Big Momma is the biggest and oldest pig around, but the piglets are the most Instagrammable. It\u2019s a short boat trip from nearby Staniel Cay to see them and around 100mi (160km) south of Nassau, the capital of the Bahamas. Pigs might not fly, but they do swim. The 152ft (46m) tall Great Isaac Lighthouse is no stranger to macabre legend. Although built to protect ships from disappearing into the Bermuda Triangle, on 4 August 1969, the keepers were reported missing, and their bodies were never found. Learn more about the secrets of this mysterious cay on a private yacht charter \u2013 book with SamBoat who have a range of skippered boats for you to climb aboard. No sailing experience required. Watch out though, those rocks are sharp. When this \u201croad\u201d was first discovered, it was thought to be from the lost city of Atlantis, which, according to Greek legends, sunk without a trace 11,000 years ago. After further scientific inspection, it was found that these black rocks were not man-made after all, no matter how much we wished the tale were true. But the site is still worth a visit to let one\u2019s imagination run wild as well as to marvel at the incredible sea life, from lobsters to lionfish, that teems here. Move over Atlas and make way for Ocean Atlas, the 18ft (6m) tall submerged girl, holding the weight of the ocean on her shoulders. This colossal sculpture by Jason deCaires Taylor was placed off the shore of Nassau to draw attention to ocean acidification, global warming, overfishing and water pollution. Made of sustainable, pH-neutral materials, this Bahamian girl serves a dual purpose: becoming an artificial reef for marine life while drawing divers away from over-stressed natural reefs. The natural arch that originally formed a bridge here was washed away long ago by violent storms, but not before being immortalised in Winslow Homer\u2019s 1885 painting Glass Window. The current concrete structure is no less striking. The skinny strip separates the north and south parts of the Bahamian island Eleuthera, with one side being pounded by the turbulent Atlantic, while the other is lazily smooched by the Bight of Eleuthera. The best place to enjoy the full two-tone panorama is from the karst hill above the bridge. President Woodrow Wilson commissioned this concrete ship when steel was in short supply in 1920. Since being grounded by a hurricane in 1926, it has lived a colourful life, having been used as a casino, oil tanker, illegal liquor warehouse and, lastly, for military target practice. It currently cuts a haunting figure, lying 15ft (5m) underwater, 4mi (6.4km) south of Bimini Island. Although broiling seas, tumultuous weather and military bombs have stripped much of the concrete hull, the SS Sapona still makes an eerily beautiful snorkelling and diving destination. This small section of old-growth woodland is one of the last-existing areas of evergreen tropical forests that used to cover the islands. Dramatic limestone caverns up to 50ft (15m) long are a highlight, accessed by boardwalks trailing through verdant foliage. Discover the cleverly camouflaged cuban tree frog, and don\u2019t forget your binoculars to spot the many bird types that flock to this time capsule of blackland coppice. Before the devastating impact of Hurricane Dorian in 2019, the Elbow Reef Lighthouse was the only manned light station in the world whose lens was still hand-wound by the keeper, rather than being electrified. The lighthouse is a valuable part of cultural history in the Bahamas and is a long-standing example of Victorian British engineering. The restoration of the lighthouse is almost complete, and the charming Gift Shoppe is once again selling wares. A blue hole is a sinkhole underneath the surface of the sea that\u2019s filled with water. Usually, they\u2019re around 100m (330ft) deep, but Dean\u2019s Blue Hole is particularly exceptional as it reaches a depth of 202m (663ft). The water here is extremely clear, with visibility reaching around 36m (118ft) on a good day. It\u2019s not surprising that Dean\u2019s is a hotspot for scuba divers and freedivers alike. Head to the bay west of Clarence Town on Long Island for your dip into the deep. This delightful museum was opened by the Hope Town community on Elbow Cay in 1978 with the aim of preserving the fascinating history of the town and educating children. The wooden clapboard building contains restored furnished rooms of yesteryear, along with stories of pirates, Lucayans, rum-runners and more. Learn all about the shipwrecks, hurricanes and torpedoed freighters that have shaped the rich history of the town, through carefully curated artefacts, photos and manuscripts.

		articleBody:
			" If you are planning to visit Albania, don\u2019t forget to include the coastal town of Vlora in your itinerary. Vlora is the third largest city in the country and one of the most beautiful to visit. It is surrounded by some of the greatest beaches in Albania, ancient monasteries, castles and archaeological parks that are unforgettable. Read our tips on spending a great weekend in this sunny town in southern Albania. Day One Morning Start your weekend in Vlora visiting Narta, a small village situated northwest of the city. Here you\u2019ll find a Greek community with a lovely, small Orthodox church and typical white houses. We strongly suggest renting a car because buses are not the best option if you want to visit unspoiled places in this area of the Land of the Eagles. Discover the Vlora: Guided City Walking Tour &gt;&gt; Next, make your way to the Zvernec Monastery, one of the most beautiful churches in the south of Albania. Don\u2019t forget to bring your camera with you to take amazing pictures of this enchanting place. Few tourists know of it, so don\u2019t be surprised if you are the only person with a camera in your hand. For tasty fish dishes, go back to the main street and choose one of the several restaurants located there. The best are the ones without signboards, frequented only by locals. View Narta Tours &gt;&gt; Afternoon As we said, the town of Vlora has plenty of interesting sights: one of the best is the archaeological park of Orikum, a small village located south of the city centre. The archaeological rests are hidden inside a navy base, so you will need special permission by the soldiers to visit it. They usually let visitors see it. Did you know that Orikum was the first city taken by Julius Caesar during his invasion of Epirus? The Roman emperor described it in his masterpiece, De Bello Civili. Albania is full of surprises. Take a look at this Sunset Boat Trip along Vlora\u2019s Coast &gt;&gt; Evening One of the best place to dine in Vlora is the recently renewed Lungomare. This boulevard offers breathtaking views over the sea and the nearby Karaburun Peninsula and Sazan Island. Lungomare has plenty of restaurants, such as Mustafa, but you\u2019ll want to keep going until you reach Uje Ftohte, at the end of the boulevard. This is where you will find Amantia, a place with a beautiful terrace frequented mostly by locals. Check out this Panoramic Tour with Snorkeling in Haxhi Ali Cave &amp; Karaburun &gt;&gt; Night During the summer months, Vlora turns into one of the liveliest places in Albania and the Balkans. Most Albanians from Tirana, Kosovo and the surrounding areas come here to spend their holidays, so Vlora has a great reputation for nightclubs. It\u2019s a great place to spend the night out having fun. The coast has plenty of great nightclubs, discotheques and caf\u00e9s. One of the coolest is Coco Bongo, a beautiful club in front of the beach. When you are ready to sleep, spend the night at Hotel Lido, one of the most beautiful accommodations in Albania. Day Two Morning The best thing to do on your second day in Vlora, is to first have a great breakfast of trilece (a cake made with milk and cream) and a Turkish coffee at the beautiful port-side cafe, Piazza, and second, buy a ticket for the Karaburun Peninsula and Sazan Island. Teuta Boat Tours departs every day at 9 am from the port of Vlora, near Hotel Bologna, and returns in town at 5 pm. In those eight hours, you will have the chance to swim in crystal clear waters, relax, visit natural caves, admire great panoramas and eat fresh fish at the restaurant located right on the beach. Have a look at this Small Group Speedboat Adventure Trip to Grama Bay &gt;&gt; Afternoon Once back in town, if you are not too tired, head to the ancient castle of Kanina to admire breathtaking views over Vlora. The castle, erected in the third century BC, was reconstructed by Justinian I in the sixth century AD and is said to be one of the oldest and largest in the Vlora region.

			" The city of Florence seems to be a museum of itself. With amazing architecture around every corner, historical buildings preserved throughout the years, and outdoor statues and sculptures sprinkled throughout the city, who needs a museum? There are statues and sculptures all over Florence, but Piazza della Signoria is the jackpot of outdoor art. Although the square is the home of the famous Palazzo Vecchio, the hub of government and politics of the time, the square offers more than architecture. To the right of the old political palace is a loggia, or outdoor room, where many sculptures are on display for all to see. Each piece has its own story and meaning, making this a must-see. The best part; it\u2019s absolutely free. Enter inside the main doors of the palace and you will find yet another outdoor (and free) surprise. The arches in the entry courtyard are intricately painted and the frescoes are well preserved so they can still be enjoyed today. The columns of the arches are each designed and carved with great craftsmanship, and the fountain in the middle is just the right touch so as to not overpower. Outside the palace, to the left of the entrance stands a life-sized replica of Michelangelo\u2019s David. Many people think he is the real deal since he seems so perfect, but David\u2018s real home is in Galleria dell\u2019Accademia. The replica stands tall and beautiful nonetheless and is a popular photo location for tourists. To the right of the entrance is Bartolomeo Bandinelli\u2019s Hercules and Cacus; a great view from all angles. To the left of David stands Neptune\u2019s Fountain, adding to even more amazing art filling the square. He is an incredibly imposing figure, and surprisingly photogenic. In another part of the city stands the great equestrian statue of Ferdinando I, the centrepiece of Piazza della Santissima Annunziata. The arches on the outside of the buildings are covered in intricate statuettess depicting the building\u2019s history as a church-run orphanage. The equestrian statue is facing the duomo of Florence, the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore, with a direct street view which makes for a great photo that many tourists miss. Adjacent to this square is the Uffizi Gallery, but you don\u2019t have to go inside to feast your eyes on some stunning sculptures and statues. Between the two wings of the gallery is the narrow courtyard walkway which takes you from Piazza della Signoria to the Arno river. Every other column of this long outdoor hallway features a statue. If you pay close attention, you will realise that you\u2019ve been walking among statues of the greats of Florence\u2019s Renaissance period. Alighieri, Botticelli, Michelangelo, Brunelleschi, Giotto, Da Vinci, and the likes stand tall and proud. Walking down this corridor is almost haunting. With their fixed marble gazes and stern expressions, these sculptures still exude knowledge and power. You can\u2019t help but feel small for a moment, thinking of the cultural inheritance we owe to these great men. Another must-see is the large statue of Dante Alighieri in front of Basilica Santa Croce. The statue was erected to celebrate the poet\u2019s 600th birthday. Though this is a large statue, his eyes are piercing. Many more notable statues in Florence are located on the grounds of Boboli Garden. Although there is an admission price of \u20ac10 (US$ 10.51), it\u2019s well worth the time spent exploring the 11 acres of green, fountains, museums, and outdoor sculptures. There are countless other statues and sculptures around the city you need to see, however the list of them all would simply be too long. Florence is absolutely full of outdoor art, so no matter what corner you turn, you\u2019re bound to be surprised by something beautiful. Explore the city and see for yourself.",
